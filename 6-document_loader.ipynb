      "What is runtime?¶\n",
      "The ADK Runtime is the underlying engine that powers your agent application during user interactions. It's the system that takes your defined agents, tools, and callbacks and orchestrates their execution in response to user input, managing the flow of information, state changes, and interactions with external services like LLMs or storage.\n",
      "Think of the Runtime as the \"engine\" of your agentic application. You define the parts (agents, tools), and the Runtime handles how they connect and run together to fulfill a user's request.\n",
      "Core Idea: The Event Loop¶\n",
      "At its heart, the ADK Runtime operates on an Event Loop. This loop facilitates a back-and-forth communication between the Runner component and your defined \"Execution Logic\" (which includes your Agents, the LLM calls they make, Callbacks, and Tools).\n",
      "\n",
      "In simple terms:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Runner receives a user query and asks the main Agent to start processing.\n",
      "The Agent (and its associated logic) runs until it has something to report (like a response, a request to use a tool, or a state change) – it then yields or emits an Event.\n",
      "The Runner receives this Event, processes any associated actions (like saving state changes via Services), and forwards the event onwards (e.g., to the user interface).\n",
      "Only after the Runner has processed the event does the Agent's logic resume from where it paused, now potentially seeing the effects of the changes committed by the Runner.\n",
      "This cycle repeats until the agent has no more events to yield for the current user query.\n",
      "\n",
      "This event-driven loop is the fundamental pattern governing how ADK executes your agent code.\n",
      "The Heartbeat: The Event Loop - Inner workings¶\n",
      "The Event Loop is the core operational pattern defining the interaction between the Runner and your custom code (Agents, Tools, Callbacks, collectively referred to as \"Execution Logic\" or \"Logic Components\" in the design document). It establishes a clear division of responsibilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "Note\n",
      "The specific method names and parameter names may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., agent_to_run.runAsync(...) in Java, agent_to_run.run_async(...) in Python). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Runner's Role (Orchestrator)¶\n",
      "The Runner acts as the central coordinator for a single user invocation. Its responsibilities in the loop are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Initiation: Receives the end user's query (new_message) and typically appends it to the session history via the SessionService.\n",
      "Kick-off: Starts the event generation process by calling the main agent's execution method (e.g., agent_to_run.run_async(...)).\n",
      "Receive & Process: Waits for the agent logic to yield or emit an Event. Upon receiving an event, the Runner promptly processes it. This involves:\n",
      "Using configured Services (SessionService, ArtifactService, MemoryService) to commit changes indicated in event.actions (like state_delta, artifact_delta).\n",
      "Performing other internal bookkeeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yield Upstream: Forwards the processed event onwards (e.g., to the calling application or UI for rendering).\n",
      "Iterate: Signals the agent logic that processing is complete for the yielded event, allowing it to resume and generate the next event.\n",

      "\n",
      "Role: A conceptual term representing everything that happens in response to a single user query, from the moment the Runner receives it until the agent logic finishes yielding events for that query.\n",
      "Function: An invocation might involve multiple agent runs (if using agent transfer or AgentTool), multiple LLM calls, tool executions, and callback executions, all tied together by a single invocation_id within the InvocationContext. State variables prefixed with temp: are strictly scoped to a single invocation and discarded afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "These players interact continuously through the Event Loop to process a user's request.\n",
      "How It Works: A Simplified Invocation¶\n",
      "Let's trace a simplified flow for a typical user query that involves an LLM agent calling a tool:\n",
      "\n",
      "Step-by-Step Breakdown¶\n",
      "\n",
      "User Input: The User sends a query (e.g., \"What's the capital of France?\").\n",
      "Runner Starts: Runner.run_async begins. It interacts with the SessionService to load the relevant Session and adds the user query as the first Event to the session history. An InvocationContext (ctx) is prepared.\n",
      "Agent Execution: The Runner calls agent.run_async(ctx) on the designated root agent (e.g., an LlmAgent).\n",
      "LLM Call (Example): The Agent_Llm determines it needs information, perhaps by calling a tool. It prepares a request for the LLM. Let's assume the LLM decides to call MyTool.\n",
      "Yield FunctionCall Event: The Agent_Llm receives the FunctionCall response from the LLM, wraps it in an Event(author='Agent_Llm', content=Content(parts=[Part(function_call=...)])), and yields or emits this event.\n",
      "Agent Pauses: The Agent_Llm's execution pauses immediately after the yield.\n",
      "Runner Processes: The Runner receives the FunctionCall event. It passes it to the SessionService to record it in the history. The Runner then yields the event upstream to the User (or application).\n",
      "Agent Resumes: The Runner signals that the event is processed, and Agent_Llm resumes execution.\n",
      "Tool Execution: The Agent_Llm's internal flow now proceeds to execute the requested MyTool. It calls tool.run_async(...).\n",
      "Tool Returns Result: MyTool executes and returns its result (e.g., {'result': 'Paris'}).\n",
      "Yield FunctionResponse Event: The agent (Agent_Llm) wraps the tool result into an Event containing a FunctionResponse part (e.g., Event(author='Agent_Llm', content=Content(role='user', parts=[Part(function_response=...)]))). This event might also contain actions if the tool modified state (state_delta) or saved artifacts (artifact_delta). The agent yields this event.\n",
      "Agent Pauses: Agent_Llm pauses again.\n",
      "Runner Processes: Runner receives the FunctionResponse event. It passes it to SessionService which applies any state_delta/artifact_delta and adds the event to history. Runner yields the event upstream.\n",
      "Agent Resumes: Agent_Llm resumes, now knowing the tool result and any state changes are committed.\n",
      "Final LLM Call (Example): Agent_Llm sends the tool result back to the LLM to generate a natural language response.\n",
      "Yield Final Text Event: Agent_Llm receives the final text from the LLM, wraps it in an Event(author='Agent_Llm', content=Content(parts=[Part(text=...)])), and yields it.\n",
      "Agent Pauses: Agent_Llm pauses.\n",
      "Runner Processes: Runner receives the final text event, passes it to SessionService for history, and yields it upstream to the User. This is likely marked as the is_final_response().\n",
      "Agent Resumes & Finishes: Agent_Llm resumes. Having completed its task for this invocation, its run_async generator finishes.\n",
      "Runner Completes: The Runner sees the agent's generator is exhausted and finishes its loop for this invocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "This yield/pause/process/resume cycle ensures that state changes are consistently applied and that the execution logic always operates on the most recently committed state after yielding an event.\n",
      "Important Runtime Behaviors¶\n",
      "Understanding a few key aspects of how the ADK Runtime handles state, streaming, and asynchronous operations is crucial for building predictable and efficient agents.\n",
      "State Updates & Commitment Timing¶\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rule: When your code (in an agent, tool, or callback) modifies the session state (e.g., context.state['my_key'] = 'new_value'), this change is initially recorded locally within the current InvocationContext. The change is only guaranteed to be persisted (saved by the SessionService) after the Event carrying the corresponding state_delta in its actions has been yield-ed by your code and subsequently processed by the Runner.\n",

      "\n",
      "Definition: While commitment happens after the yield, code running later within the same invocation, but before the state-changing event is actually yielded and processed, can often see the local, uncommitted changes. This is sometimes called a \"dirty read\".\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "PythonJava\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "# Code in before_agent_callback\n",
      "callback_context.state['field_1'] = 'value_1'\n",

      "\n",
      "# Assume the event carrying the state_delta={'field_1': 'value_1'}\n",
      "# is yielded *after* this tool runs and is processed by the Runner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "// Modify state - Code in BeforeAgentCallback\n",
      "// AND stages this change in callbackContext.eventActions().stateDelta().\n",
      "callbackContext.state().put(\"field_1\", \"value_1\");\n",
      "\n",
      "// --- agent runs ... ---\n",
      "\n",
      "// --- Code in a tool called later *within the same invocation* ---\n",
      "// Readable (dirty read), but 'value_1' isn't guaranteed persistent yet.\n",
      "Object val = toolContext.state().get(\"field_1\"); // 'val' will likely be 'value_1' here\n",
      "System.out.println(\"Dirty read value in tool: \" + val);\n",
      "// Assume the event carrying the state_delta={'field_1': 'value_1'}\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Implications:\n",
      "Benefit: Allows different parts of your logic within a single complex step (e.g., multiple callbacks or tool calls before the next LLM turn) to coordinate using state without waiting for a full yield/commit cycle.\n",
      "Caveat: Relying heavily on dirty reads for critical logic can be risky. If the invocation fails before the event carrying the state_delta is yielded and processed by the Runner, the uncommitted state change will be lost. For critical state transitions, ensure they are associated with an event that gets successfully processed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Streaming vs. Non-Streaming Output (partial=True)¶\n",
      "This primarily relates to how responses from the LLM are handled, especially when using streaming generation APIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Streaming: The LLM generates its response token-by-token or in small chunks.\n",
      "The framework (often within BaseLlmFlow) yields multiple Event objects for a single conceptual response. Most of these events will have partial=True.\n",
      "The Runner, upon receiving an event with partial=True, typically forwards it immediately upstream (for UI display) but skips processing its actions (like state_delta).\n",
      "Eventually, the framework yields a final event for that response, marked as non-partial (partial=False or implicitly via turn_complete=True).\n",
      "The Runner fully processes only this final event, committing any associated state_delta or artifact_delta.\n",
      "Non-Streaming: The LLM generates the entire response at once. The framework yields a single event marked as non-partial, which the Runner processes fully.\n",
      "Why it Matters: Ensures that state changes are applied atomically and only once based on the complete response from the LLM, while still allowing the UI to display text progressively as it's generated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Async is Primary (run_async)¶\n",
      "\n",
      "Core Design: The ADK Runtime is fundamentally built on asynchronous libraries (like Python's asyncio and Java's RxJava) to handle concurrent operations (like waiting for LLM responses or tool executions) efficiently without blocking.\n",
      "Main Entry Point: Runner.run_async is the primary method for executing agent invocations. All core runnable components (Agents, specific flows) use asynchronous methods internally.\n",
      "Synchronous Convenience (run): A synchronous Runner.run method exists mainly for convenience (e.g., in simple scripts or testing environments). However, internally, Runner.run typically just calls Runner.run_async and manages the async event loop execution for you.\n",
      "Developer Experience: We recommend designing your applications (e.g., web servers using ADK) to be asynchronous for best performance. In Python, this means using asyncio; in Java, leverage RxJava's reactive programming model.\n",
      "Sync Callbacks/Tools: The ADK framework supports both asynchronous and synchronous functions for tools and callbacks.\n",
      "Blocking I/O: For long-running synchronous I/O operations, the framework attempts to prevent stalls. Python ADK may use asyncio.to_thread, while Java ADK often relies on appropriate RxJava schedulers or wrappers for blocking calls.\n",
      "CPU-Bound Work: Purely CPU-intensive synchronous tasks will still block their execution thread in both environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding these behaviors helps you write more robust ADK applications and debug issues related to state consistency, streaming updates, and asynchronous execution.\n",
